# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: January 7, 2020 
##### (I confess that i started this round since december 2019, but had to discontinue due to my frustration at React.js. I went through several tutorials and felt i understood what it was all about. Yet, when it was time to build projects, i blanked out. I wasn't sure of what to do next after creating all the components and modules. I wasnt even sure of why React was even necessary in the first place(Managing Complex State(data)....yeah. Now, explain that to an 8-year old) I've now come to realize that what i was going through is called Tutorial Hell. Someone on youtube(Whatsdev) said if you didnt understand a js framework, chances are you dont understand JS as much as you should. He also said that the best way to learn JS is to go through a book and blog posts. So, i decided to go back to vanilla JS and intro to CS. No frameworks for now. Resources i'm using are: 1. Eloquent Javascript 2. You dont know JS yet book series on github 3. Four Semesters of CS in 5 hours by Brian Holt)


**Today's Progress**: 
1) I understand what big O notation is all about and how to guess it for constant time(O(1)), loops => linear time(O(n)), recursion => (O(logn)), loop inside loop(n^2) etc. 
2) Used Jasmine for unit testing on codepen. it was fun to see my recursive factorial solution pass the tests, changing them from red to green.
3) 

**Thoughts**: I should learn how to use Canvas and Svgs...well, master CSS really.
