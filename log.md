# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: January 7, 2020 
##### (I confess that i started this round since december 2019, but had to discontinue due to my frustration at React.js. I went through several tutorials and felt i understood what it was all about. Yet, when it was time to build projects, i blanked out. I wasn't sure of what to do next after creating all the components and modules. I wasnt even sure of why React was even necessary in the first place(Managing Complex State(data)....yeah. Now, explain that to an 8-year old) I've now come to realize that what i was going through is called Tutorial Hell. Someone on youtube(Whatsdev) said if you didnt understand a js framework, chances are you dont understand JS as much as you should. He also said that the best way to learn JS is to go through a book and blog posts. So, i decided to go back to vanilla JS and intro to CS. No frameworks for now. Resources i'm using are: 1. Eloquent Javascript 2. You dont know JS yet book series on github 3. Four Semesters of CS in 5 hours by Brian Holt)


**Today's Progress**: 
1) I understand what big O notation is all about and how to guess it for constant time(O(1)), loops => linear time(O(n)), recursion => (O(logn)), loop inside loop(n^2) etc. 
2) Used Jasmine for unit testing on codepen. it was fun to see my recursive factorial solution pass the tests, changing them from red to green.
3) 

**Thoughts**: I should learn how to use Canvas and Svgs...well, master CSS really.

### Day 9: January 21, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
1) I built an app that changes the page background colour by generating a random hex color code and printing it out on the UI.
2) I built a simple JS image slider and a message board where you post messages and they are printed out on the screen
3) Thanks to Wes Bos's JS30, i build a JS drumkit. This one was really fun.

**Thoughts**: Still have to improve on the drumkit page's responsiveness on smaller screens

### Day 10: January 22, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
1) I built a booklist app using plain JS and Localstorage where you can create, read, update and delete data from. 
2.) I see the need for using modules in React. It makes your code so much more easier to look at.

**Thoughts**: I should build something that uses routing next.

### Day 11: January 28, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
1) I played around with css variables and learnt how to change them with JS

**Thoughts**: I reserve my comments.

### Day 12: January 29, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
1) I built a weather app that fetched the weather in my location from darksky.net api. I used features such as fetch,navigator in the browser and cors-anywhere proxy

**Thoughts**: So far so good

### Day 13: January 30, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
1) I built a weather app where you can enter a city and country and you get the weather conditions there displayed on your app. I used OpenWeatherMap api to make the calls.

**Thoughts**: Now i see another way React helps with writing JS. I dont have to select DOM elements manually to modify them. I simply write my JSX and react renders them for me.
